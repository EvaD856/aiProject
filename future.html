		<h1>Future</h1>
		<h2>Growth and Popularity</h2>
		<p>Some people hardly want anything to do with AI, but the truth is that it's going to impact everybody whether they want it to or not. It will contine to be part of our lives 5 to 10 to 20 years down the road and beyond. Although AI will look different and have different effects on different asepcts of the world, changing everyday. AI is rapidly evolving along with it's popularity. An aspect of AI that is growing is the growth in multimodality with complexity and accuracy. Meaning that AI can generate enhanced quality images and better capabilities for videos. </p>
		
		<h2>Jobs</h2>
		<p>Some people worry about robots and AI taking over their jobs. And it's be fair to have that worry, AI will replace some occupations, but will also be creating new jobs. And for some people the introduction of AI into their job could help them with their job, using it as a tool rather than it replacing it. AI is already smarter than us, and AI will be getting closer to outperform humans with tasks and critical thinking.</p>
		
		<h2>What Are We Doing?</h2>
		<p>AI makes a lot of people about what it will do to our future and the many possibilities that it could go wrong. Although new regulations will be put into place for AI as the government understands more of it and as it gets more popular. Improvements on security will also be occuring. Although if we don't put regulations, more specifically for environmental, the construction of AI models could increase carbon emissions as much as 80% if no regulations are put into place.</p>
